            <p>
                All packages are non-refundable. You can only cancel a plan within 24 hours of starting and prior to the
                counselling call with Nancy (this happens after you have purchased the plan).
            </p>
            <p>Once initial counselling is done, the package cannot be cancelled or transferred.</p>
            <p>
                You cannot freeze monthly plans. It is highly recommended to complete your monthly plan in one go to see
                best results.
            </p>
            <p>
                In case of sickness, emergency, or unavoidable circumstances, a healthy discussion for the best possible
                solution will be conducted. Nancy will have the sole power of taking the decision after going through
                your problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have chosen a three-monthly plan, you can freeze it for a period of 14 days maximum. The time
                frame cannot be divided and has to be used in one go. The plan cannot be cancelled or transferred after
                the initial counselling call. For further assistance, contact Nancy directly.

            <h4 class="mt-4">21 Days Challenge</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The 21 days challenge under Nancy Dehra is a 3 weeks program that starts on
                a set date every month. The date is notified on my Instagram handle well in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will receive a diet plan every week on the given WhatsApp number. The plan is individualized and
                created to suit your body type. It is not a one-size-fits-all plan. You will get a plan according to
                your metabolic rate and health conditions specified.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your exercise plan will be sent in the group &amp; individually, which will be common for all. Please put
                a star on the important messages. I will be giving options of workouts to suit your body type. Please
                pick the one that works best for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The program is restricted to 21 days and will not be extended for anyone in any scenario including
                sickness, travel, or any unprecedented events.
            </p>
            <p>
                In case of an emergency, you can choose to restart the diet individually whenever you are ready. (You can
                still ask me for doubts and send me progress updates.)
            </p>
            <p>
                I will be sending the remainder of the diet (week-wise) if you are not able to follow the diet due to any
                unforeseen reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                Money will not be refunded for the program in any scenario. Also, you cannot carry forward the amount for
                upcoming challenges if you choose not to follow it for whatsoever reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                For your convenience, if you’re not able to start the challenge in the desired state (pre-approved &amp;
                strong reasons only), you can choose to follow the diet whenever you are ready and can still send me
                weight updates, weekly results, and clear doubts, even after 21 days (but on personal window).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to start your challenge 1-3 days before or later than the starting date, you need to inform
                me beforehand. In this scenario, your date will commence after you start the challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are in any other country, your time for the challenge will start and finish as per your time zone.
                Also, the challenge has set rules to maintain decorum and respect the privacy of the members. I reserve
                the right to remove anyone from the group if I see you going against the rules.
