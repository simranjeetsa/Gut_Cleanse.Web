When gut bacteria fall out of balance (dysbiosis), it can trigger a cascade of health issues:</p><ul class="list-item"><li><h4><span class=""><img alt="arrow" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="fa-spin" sizes="100vw" src="~/Assets/dna.png" style="color: transparent; width: auto; height: auto;"></span> Chronic inflammation and bloating</h4></li><li><h4><span class=""><img alt="arrow" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="fa-spin" sizes="100vw" src="~/Assets/dna.png" style="color: transparent; width: auto; height: auto;"></span> Compromised nutrient absorption</h4></li> <li><h4><span class=""><img alt="arrow" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="fa-spin" sizes="100vw" src="~/Assets/dna.png" style="color: transparent; width: auto; height: auto;"></span> Irregular bowel movements</h4></li> <li><h4><span class=""><img alt="arrow" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="fa-spin" sizes="100vw" src="~/Assets/dna.png" style="color: transparent; width: auto; height: auto;"></span> Mood fluctuations and anxiety</h4></li> <li><h4><span class=""><img alt="arrow" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="fa-spin" sizes="100vw" src="~/Assets/dna.png" style="color: transparent; width: auto; height: auto;"></span> Hormonal imbalances</h4></li><li><h4><span class=""><img alt="arrow" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="fa-spin" sizes="100vw" src="~/Assets/dna.png" style="color: transparent; width: auto; height: auto;"></span> Unexplained weight changes</h4></li><li><h4><span class=""><img alt="arrow" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="fa-spin" sizes="100vw" src="~/Assets/dna.png" style="color: transparent; width: auto; height: auto;"></span> Skin problems and inflammation </h4></li><li><h4><span class=""><img alt="arrow" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="fa-spin" sizes="100vw" src="~/Assets/dna.png" style="color: transparent; width: auto; height: auto;"></span> Autoimmune responses </h4></li></ul><a class="btn-red theme-btn mt-4" href="/programs">Enroll now</a>
